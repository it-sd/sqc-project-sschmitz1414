Recognition rather than recall & Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
------------------------------
* I am going to make the information pages easy to view and also make it easy to traverse between the different pages to increase usability of finding the correct information. I might use visuals such as icons to make clear indications to increase usability by having it be more obvious what to press for a specific action. I am only going to include the necessary information by using tables rather than full on paragraphs to decrease usability and make it easier to find the necessary information rather than struggling to pick out the necessary information from the "filler" information. As I would like to say, I am going to make it in Powerpoint Format not Word Format. This means I want to focus more on "bullet points" rather than "paragraphs" so that the user feels like they are getting information not an essay.

* I am using Purple, Pink, Red, Black, and White. I chose black as the background color because I like dark themes. Also, both pink and purple feel like space which is on-theme. Furthermore, purple is my favorite color and it works well with black. Lastly, I like that the color palette are cool colors and warm colors that are next to one another on the color wheel.
* I am going to use 1-3 fonts, if I use multiple it is likely that it will be to separate the headers, paragraphs, and table text. Another typographic convention I will use is changing the text colors based on format type such as headers and paragraphs. I might bold important information such as instructions to the user. Additionally, I might talicize when there is a lack of information such as N/A. Lastly, I might use bulleted lists when listing information oustide of the tables.
